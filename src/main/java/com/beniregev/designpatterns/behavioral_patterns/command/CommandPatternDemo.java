/**
 * Command pattern is a data driven design pattern and falls under behavioral pattern category. A request is
 * wrapped under an object as command and passed to invoker object. Invoker object looks for the appropriate
 * object which can handle this command and passes the command to the corresponding object which executes the
 * command.
 * <p>
 * Implementation
 * We have created an interface Order which is acting as a command. We have created a Stock class which acts
 * as a request. We have concrete command classes BuyStock and SellStock implementing Order interface which
 * will do actual command processing. A class Broker is created which acts as an invoker object. It can take
 * and place orders.
 * <p>
 * Broker object uses command pattern to identify which object will execute which command based on the type
 * of command. CommandPatternDemo, our demo class, will use Broker class to demonstrate command pattern.
