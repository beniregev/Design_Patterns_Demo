/**
 * <p>
 * Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite
 * pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy. This type of
 * design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree structure of group of objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects. This class provides ways to modify its group
 * of same objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We are demonstrating use of composite pattern via following example in which we will show employees hierarchy of
 * an organization.
 * </p>
 * <div>
 * Implementation
 * </div>
 * <p>
 * We have a class {@link Employee} which acts as composite pattern actor class. {@link CompositePatternDemo}, our
 * demo class will use {@link Employee} class to add department level hierarchy and print all employees.
 * </p>
