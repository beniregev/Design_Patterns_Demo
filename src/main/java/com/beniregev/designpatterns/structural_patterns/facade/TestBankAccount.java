 *         Welcome to may Facade Design Pattern Tutorial! The Facade
 *         pattern is extremely easy to understand. Chances are you
 *         have used it already and just didn't know it.
 *     </p>
 *     <p>
 *         The Facade pattern basically says that you should
 *         simplify your methods so that much of what is done is
 *         in the background. In technical terms you should decouple
 *         the client from the sub components needed to perform an
 *         operation.
